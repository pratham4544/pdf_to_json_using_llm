In view of above, the Group has \\naccounted for its share of profits or losses of Nil in GGICO based on the unaudited/ unreviewed financial results certified by the Management of the Holding \\nCompany . Management believes that the impact of any further adjustments arising from such unaudited/ unreviewed financial Information is not expected to be \\nmaterial to the accompanying financial results. Considering the estimated future business results and cashftows once the project resumes, Management \\nbelieves that the realisable amount of investment in joint venture is higher than the carrying value of the non-current investments and non-current loans. \\n4 Non-current investments as at 31 December 2024 includes t 2,135.73 lakhs representing amount receivable from Piramal Sunteck Realty Private Limited, a \\njoint venture of the Group, which is in the business of real-estate development Non-current financial assets of such joint venture includes other receivables \\naggregating~ 1,715.46 lakhs (the Group\\'s share~ 857.73 lakhs) paid to City and Industrial Development Corporation (\\'CIDCO\\') on account of additional lease \\npremium paid under protest for extension of lime in respect of development of a project due to various delays in obtaining required approvals from the respective \\nauthorities and wrong interpretation by authority on applicability of specific rule on the project, though the same was not applicable to the project which has been \\nsubsequently clarified by the Government of Maharashtra . Further, during the earlier year, the joint venture company filed a writ petition before the Hon\\'ble \\nBombay High Court challenging the levy of the additional lease premium by CIDCO, which is pending for hearing as on date. Basis a legal opinion obtained on \\nthe matter, Management strongly believes that such receivable is fully recoverable and accordingly, these amounts have been considered as good and \\nrecoverable . • • \\n5 The Board of Directors of the Holding Company in its meetings held on 26 May 2023 and 10 November 2022 had approved arrangement for amalgamations of \\nerstwhile wholly owned subsidiaries, i) Skystar Buildcon Private Limited, Advaith lnfraprojects Private Limited, Shivay Brokers Private Limited and Magnate \\nIndustries Private Limited (previously known as Magnate Industries LLP) (\\'Transferor Companies\") and ii) Starlight Systems (1) Private Limited (previously known \\nas Starlight System (I) LLP) (\\'Transferor Company\\'\\') respectively with the Holding Company , which have been approved by the Hon\\'ble National Company Law \\nTribunal (\\'NCL T\\') vide orders dated 1 O May 2024 and 29 July 2024, respectively . The certified copy of the Orders had been filed with Registrar of Companies, \\nMumbai (\\'ROC\\') on 17 May 2024 and 2 August 2024, respectively, on which the respective Schemes became effective. The aforesaid amalgamations, being a \\ncommon control transaction, have no impact on the financial results. \\n6 During the previous year to date period ended 31 December 2023, the Holding Company has received interest of ~ 1,500.00 lakhs as part of one time \\nsettlement , which is included in the \"Other income\" in the financial results. \\n7 During the current quarter, the Holding Company has issued 2,665 equity shares of face value of, 1 each at a premium of, 224 per equity share pursuant to \\nexercise of Employee Stock Option Schemes (ESOS) by the holders. \\n8 The Nomination and Remuneration Committee, in the current quarter, by way of a resolution passed by circulation dated 4 October 2024, granted 336,068 stock \\noptions to the eligible employees of the Group and its joint venture, under Sunteck Realty Limited Employees\\' Stock Option Scheme 2019 (\"ESOS 2019\"). \\n9 The Group\\'s primary business segment is reflected based ori principal business activities carried on by the Group.

    "### **System Prompt: Extract Financial Data from PDFs and Convert to JSON**\n",
    "#### **Objective:**\n",
    "Extract financial data from the given PDF file, ensuring all **standalone** and **consolidated** financial results are accurately captured for **all time periods** (quarters, nine-month periods, year-end results) and converted into structured JSON format.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Step-by-Step Reasoning (Chain of Thought Approach)**:\n",
    "1. **Read the PDF File**  \n",
    "   - Identify all **tables** containing financial data.  \n",
    "   - Ignore unnecessary text, page numbers, and irrelevant metadata.  \n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Extract and Structure Data**  \n",
    "   - **Remove unnecessary columns** such as `Line Items`, `SR No`, `Page No`.  \n",
    "   - **Convert important row labels into JSON keys** and their corresponding values into JSON values.  \n",
    "   - Ensure each financial statement has a **consistent structure**.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Ensure Completeness**  \n",
    "   - Capture data for **all periods** (not just the first one).  \n",
    "   - Include **all financial metrics** such as **Revenue, Expenses, Taxes, Profit/Loss, Comprehensive Income, EPS**.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Standardize Key Formatting**  \n",
    "   - Convert **date formats** to a uniform structure (e.g., `31-DEC-2024`).  \n",
    "   - Ensure **nested JSON format** for categories like **Tax Expenses, Earnings per Share (EPS)**.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Handle Missing Data**  \n",
    "   - If a value is missing or not found, replace it with `\"...\"` instead of `null` or `None`.  \n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Output the Final JSON in a Clean Format**  \n",
    "   - Ensure proper **indentation and readability**.  \n",
    "   - Remove redundant whitespace or special characters.\n",
